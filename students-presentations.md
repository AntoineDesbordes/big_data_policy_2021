# Student presentations

At almost every lecture, we will discuss two prescribed papers (i.e. that I have either allocated or approved ahead of time). Each paper will be presented (15 minutes) by a group of two students and then discussed (10 minutes) in class. Students not presenting should prepare questions on one of the two papers.

Please push your presentations to this repo as separate sub-directories, indicating the order that you presented, your name, and a v. brief description, all separated by dashes. E.g.: `01-FirstnameLastname-Au1Au2Au3YYYY/`.

## Presentation content and format

The presentation should be using slides and be structured around the following dimensions:
- Give a brief summary of what the article was about:
  - What are the key (research) questions the author(s) are trying to address?
  - Does the paperâ€™s result rely on theoretical or empirical hypothesis?
  - What are the main results?
  - If the paper is long, you can spend more time on one aspect of the results.
- Critical assessment:
  - What is your opinion of the article?
  - What are the strengths and the limitations of the paper that you would like to bring forward?

## Article list and schedule

Articles will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. Each person is expected to present twice. Please add your name to the table below (you can [edit this README](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) directly on GitHub) as soon as you have chosen.
