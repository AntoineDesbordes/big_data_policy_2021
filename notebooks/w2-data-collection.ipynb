This latest standoff offered a rare opportunity for Congress and the president to change course, make real reductions in spending, lower federal deficits, and address the unfunded liabilities that threaten U.S. solvency. Unfortunately, none of that happened. This good-faith deal calms fear of default for now, but we must take advantage of the next 90 days to finally work together and get our spending under control.\"[94]No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013Moran voted against H.R.325 -- No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013.

Paul started the filibuster in order to highlight his concerns about the administration's drone policies.

Paul and other civil liberties activists were critical of President Obama for not offering a clear response to the question. A total of 14 senators joined Paul in the filibuster—13 Republicans and one Democrat.[99][100][101]\n",

      "“Standing up to Democrats — and Republicans — who Spend Recklessly, Borrow Continually and Tax Repeatedly: Jerry Moran has consistently gone against the tide in Washington and fought Congress’ tax-and-spend problem. He thinks Congress is hemorrhaging money at an alarming rate and must be reminded that spending trillions of dollars — that we do not have — undermines economic recovery today and the future of our children and grandchildren who will have to pay these crippling debts. He is committed to opposing reckless spending and reining in big government in a fiscally responsible way to help Kansas families and businesses.Leading Voice for Kansas Agriculture: Growing up in Western Kansas taught Jerry Moran that government can make the lives of Kansas farmers and ranchers more difficult by creating uncertainty and throwing needless regulations, taxes, fees, and restrictions our way. Jerry believes that regulators and bureaucrats need to let farmers and ranchers be the responsible stewards of the land that they always have been.Consistent Conservative Who Stands Firm Against President Obama’s Executive Overreach: Jerry Moran has fought the president’s agenda from the outset. As a member of the House of Representatives, he was the first representative to file legislation to repeal Obamacare. In the Senate, he continues to fight to repeal Obamacare.A Trusted Protector and Proven Defender of the Second Amendment: He is a champion of the Second Amendment and has been a leader of the opposition to the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. Jerry Moran has spoken out repeatedly against the Obama Administration’s attempts to reverse U.S. policies, abandon its own red line negotiation principles, and admit publicly the treaty’s dangerous ambiguity. He believes we must reject this treaty, which fails to exempt civilian firearms from its scope, and instead uphold the fundamental individual rights of Americans.Cherishing Life. Safeguarding our Freedoms. Reclaiming our American Values: Jerry Moran is, and always has been, pro-life. He believes life is precious and deserves our respect and protection. Science reveals that each human life begins at conception, and Jerry believes the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being. This right is sacred.[110]”—Jerry Moran's campaign website,https://www.moranforkansas.com/priorities/\n",

      "Roger MarshallParty:Republican PartyIncumbent:NoPolitical Office:U.S. House(Assumed office: 2017)Biography:Marshall graduated with a B.S. in biochemistry from Kansas State University and an M.D. from the University of Kansas. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1984 to 1991. Marshall practiced medicine as an OB/GYN in Great Bend, Kansas, and served as chairman of the board of Great Bend Regional Hospital.Key messagesMarshall said he had delivered on the three promises he made when elected to Congress: “Get Kansas a seat back on the Agriculture Committee, help write a Farm Bill that protects crop insurance, and jumpstart the economy by rolling back regulation and passing a tax cuts bill.”Marshall emphasized his background as an OB/GYN and his efforts in Congress to eliminate taxpayer funding for abortions, defund Planned Parenthood, and ban abortion after 20 weeks nationwide.Marshall said Bollier was too liberal for Kansas. A campaign ad said Bollier \"voted for dismemberment abortions ... , pushed a gun ban in Kansas,\" and supported \"taxpayer-funded tuition for illegal immigrants.\"Sources:Roger Marshall 2020 campaign website, \"Home,\" accessed September 17, 2020;Roger Marshall 2020 campaign website, \"Issues,\" accessed September 17, 2020;YouTube, \"Hear This,\" September 7, 2020;Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, \"MARSHALL, Roger Wayne (1960-),\" accessed May 3, 2020;Congressman Roger Marshall, \"About Me,\" accessed May 3, 2020;Roger Marshall 2020 campaign website, \"Meet Doc,\" accessed May 3, 2020\n",

      "Roger Marshall did not completeBallotpedia's 2020 Candidate Connectionsurvey.Campaign websiteMarshall's campaign website stated the following:“COMMONSENSE PROBLEM-SOLVINGDr. Marshall always says that the best physicians are the best listeners, and he believes the same is true for elected office. Not only is Dr. Marshall committed to conservative Kansas values, but he is committed to being a leader who will listen to those who elect him. That’s why he’s done more town halls than any Member of Congress.This does not mean Dr. Marshall will agree with everyone, but it does mean he will engage voters and actually listen to our concerns and won’t be beholden to those special interests handing out meaningless indexes and scorecards.HEALTHCARE REFORMAs a physician, Doc has seen firsthand the negative consequences of government-controlled healthcare systems. Obamacare, and now, government-controlled socialized medicine are some of the most egregious examples of what Doc has fought against.Government-run healthcare has not only harmed small business, but directly interferes with the doctor-patient relationship. For health care delivery to thrive in America and rural Kansas, we must repeal and replace these broken systems.In Congress, Congressman Marshall voted in favor of the repeal of the individual mandate, repeal of the Cadillac tax, and the repeal of the medical device tax; all of which President Trump then signed into law. Dr. Marshall supports covering individuals with pre-existing conditions.PRO-LIFE LEADERSHIPDoc committed his professional life to bringing life into this world, and he knows a child is a living creation of God from the moment of conception.Congressman Marshall is staunchly pro-life and opposes all efforts to use taxpayer funding for abortions. As a physician who has delivered over 5,000 babies in his 25 years practicing in Great Bend, Dr. Marshall saw human life at its most vulnerable every day.In Congress, Dr. Marshall co-sponsored bills that would: eliminate all taxpayer funding for abortions, defund Planned Parenthood, and make any abortion after 20 weeks illegal nationwide. Dr. Marshall is also a proud cosponsor of “The Heartbeat Bill,” and believes that life begins at conception, and should be protected and cherished from that point on.Read more →“I will never waiver in my support for life in Congress. I encourage those who advocate for so-called “choice” to visit me so I can tell them the stories of many brave women who have brought joy into this world even through the most difficult circumstances.”- Dr. Roger MarshallJOBS AND THE ECONOMYOur job as leaders is to make the complicated simple, not complicate the simple. The less control the federal government has, the better off we will be. By getting Washington out of the way, lowering taxes, and decreasing regulation we are seeing the new age of American greatness again.For our rural ag economy, it is vital that our producers have fair trade deals to get their commodities to an international market. Doc has and will continue to fight for farmers and ranchers in Washington.Read my economic plan for Kansas →2ND AMENDMENTDr. Marshall is a lifetime member of the NRA. The most basic role of government is to defend Americans and to never encroach on citizens’ right to defend themselves. In Congress, Dr. Marshall has always made sure that your 2nd Amendment rights are never infringed upon.NATIONAL DEFENSEWe must get our federal government back to its core functions – chief among them is national defense. America is the world’s pre-eminent superpower. When American lives or interests are in danger, our enemies now know we will act swiftly and decisively.Congressman Marshall proudly supported a twenty-percent increase in military funding in order to fully fund Ft. Riley and the largest pay increase for our troops in 9 years. We must be certain the brave men and women protecting us have the tools and training they need to be successful on the battlefield, and the confidence that America will never renege on the promises made to them as veterans.IMMIGRATION & BORDER SECURITYI've been to the border several times. I know it is a crisis, and President Trump is right: we must build a wall and fix our broken immigration system, and we have to turn off the magnets that attract, promote, encourage and allow migrants to enter our country under false pretenses.Until we build a wall, and until we turn off the laws that only serve as magnets, all the money in the world will not have a huge humanitarian impact. We can build more shelters, we can send more doctors and nurses, more food and water, but proportionately more people will die trying to get to this country.Rep. Roger Marshall: Border wall will help people on both sides -- Trump is rightREAD MORE >AGRICULTURE AND TRADEAgriculture is the lifeblood of Kansas, and we Kansans know our land better than federal bureaucrats. Puddles are puddles – they are not wetlands. Ditches are ditches – they are not navigable streams. Lesser Prairie Chickens are great birds, but the economic consequences of federally listing them as “threatened” are totally unjustified. Farm dust does settle and is not a visibility or clean-air issue to be controlled by unelected Washington bureaucrats.In Congress, Dr. Marshall played a key role in the 2018 Farm Bill; advocating for fully funded crop insurance, overturning the egregious EPA rules surrounding Waters of The US (WOTUS), and securing crucial infrastructure and internet access funding for rural Kansas. Congressman Marshall also supported a food stamp work requirement that would require able-bodied adults without children to work or work training for 20 hours per week in order to receive welfare benefits.In the Spring of 2018, Congressman Marshall was asked to represent U.S. agriculture at the final round of NAFTA negotiations in Mexico City. Since then, the new USMCA trade deal has been revealed, and must be passed.Nothing would have a greater impact on the Kansas economy, and Congressman Marshall has been a vocal critic of Nancy Pelosi for refusing to take it to the House floor. Dr. Marshall agrees with President Trump that the United States has been taken advantage of for far too long, but we must consider and prevent adverse effects trade wars could have on our farmers and ranchers.[43]”—Roger Marshall's campaign website (2020)[44]2016The following issues were listed on Marshall's campaign website. For a full list of campaign themes,click here.“Healthcare: The most important issue in health care is the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship. When government gets involved, prices increase and quality of care decreases. By interfering with the free market, government creates distortions that have led to more government intervention. Obamacare, or the so-called Affordable Care Act, is neither affordable nor caring – it must be repealed and replaced.The Kansas Economy: The best way to encourage job creation is to get government out of the way and allow the entrepreneurial spirit to prosper. Too often, businesses growth is stymied by complex regulations with ever changing interpretations and laws which are passed though they were never read in their entirety. Too often, the hands of business leaders are tied and stagnation, rather than growth, incentivized.Pro-Life: Roger Marshall is staunchly pro-life and will oppose any efforts to ever use taxpayer funding for abortions.2nd Amendment & National Defense: The most basic role of government is to defend Americans and to never encroach on citizens’ right to also defend themselves. Dr. Marshall will make sure that your 2nd Amendment rights are never infringed upon. We must ensure that Ft. Riley and our other military installations are fully funded.Agriculture & EPA: Agriculture is the life blood of Kansas and we Kansans know our land better than federal bureaucrats. Puddles are puddles – they are not wetlands. Ditches are ditches – they are not navigable streams. Lesser Prairie Chickens are great birds, but the economic consequences of federally listing them as “threatened” are totally unjustified. Farm dust does settle and is not a visibility or clean-air issue to be controlled by unelected Washington bureaucrats.[43]”—Roger Marshall's campaign website,http://www.kansansformarshall.com/issuesNoteworthy eventsElectoral vote certification on January 6-7, 2021See also:Counting of electoral votes (January 6-7, 2021)Congress convened a joint session on January 6-7, 2021, to count electoral votes by state and confirm the results of the2020 presidential election. Marshall voted against certifying the electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. The Senate rejected both objections by a vote of 6-93 for Arizona and 7-92 for Pennsylvania.Campaign donorsComprehensive donor history.cftable {\n",

Raised in metro Detroit, I've spent my entire life in service to our state - as a businessman, in the military and now in public office. Like many Michiganders, my path wasn't traditional. After graduating from Alma College, I started raising a family and working full-time and put myself through night school. Early in my work as a financial advisor, I helped families plan for their retirement and save for their children's college education. Ultimately, my value of service led me to join the U.S. Navy Reserve, where I rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and then rejoined after the September 11th attacks. And now during my service in Congress, I've strengthened economic relief and fought for a more robust medical response for Michiganders during the coronavirus crisis.  I'm proud to be ranked as one of the most effective and bipartisan members of the Senate where I've worked to give middle class families independent representation by fighting to protect access to health care and lower prescription drug costs, supporting small businesses, preparing Michigan for the jobs of tomorrow, and defending our Great Lakes.\"Key messagesBipartisan and Effective. I've made it my top priority to work across the aisle to get results and make government work for Michigan. That's why nonpartisan groups like the Center for Effective Lawmaking and the McCourt School of Public Policy have ranked me as one of the most effective and bipartisan members of the Senate, and I'm proud to have received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Jefferson-Hamilton Award for Bipartisanship.Fighting to Keep Washington Transparent and Accountable. Growing up, I was raised to believe you don't spend money you don't have. That's why I've run my office so frugally that I've returned over $2 million in taxpayer dollars to the U.S. Treasury. And I'm constantly working to keep Washington transparent and accountable. I've cut red tape, voted against congressional pay raises, passed legislation to eliminate millions in wasteful government spending and as the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, I've led investigations to hold government agencies accountable for improper spending and will continue to help make our government work better for Michigan.Focused on Putting Michigan First. In the Senate, I've passed into law legislation to help lower prescription drug costs, expand skills training opportunities to fill good-paying jobs, secure relief during the coronavirus pandemic, and to protect our Great Lakes. I'm working to rebuild our economy by pushing to expand Made in America manufacturing and supporting our small businesses. And as a leader on national security and veterans' issues, my top priority is keeping Michigan safe. I've worked with both parties to pass into law legislation to strengthen our military, and take care of our veterans by expanding apprenticeship opportunities and ensure those who are struggling with PTSD have access to the care they deserve.\n",

      "Who are you? Tell us about yourself.My family has called Michigan home for five generations. Raised in metro Detroit, I've spent my entire life in service to our state - as a businessman, in the military and now in public office. Like many Michiganders, my path wasn't traditional. After graduating from Alma College, I started raising a family and working full-time and put myself through night school. Early in my work as a financial advisor, I helped families plan for their retirement and save for their children's college education. Ultimately, my value of service led me to join the U.S. Navy Reserve, where I rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and then rejoined after the September 11th attacks. And now during my service in Congress, I've strengthened economic relief and fought for a more robust medical response for Michiganders during the coronavirus crisis.  I'm proud to be ranked as one of the most effective and bipartisan members of the Senate where I've worked to give middle class families independent representation by fighting to protect access to health care and lower prescription drug costs, supporting small businesses, preparing Michigan for the jobs of tomorrow, and defending our Great Lakes.Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?Bipartisan and Effective. I've made it my top priority to work across the aisle to get results and make government work for Michigan. That's why nonpartisan groups like the Center for Effective Lawmaking and the McCourt School of Public Policy have ranked me as one of the most effective and bipartisan members of the Senate, and I'm proud to have received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Jefferson-Hamilton Award for Bipartisanship.Fighting to Keep Washington Transparent and Accountable. Growing up, I was raised to believe you don't spend money you don't have. That's why I've run my office so frugally that I've returned over $2 million in taxpayer dollars to the U.S. Treasury. And I'm constantly working to keep Washington transparent and accountable. I've cut red tape, voted against congressional pay raises, passed legislation to eliminate millions in wasteful government spending and as the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, I've led investigations to hold government agencies accountable for improper spending and will continue to help make our government work better for Michigan.Focused on Putting Michigan First. In the Senate, I've passed into law legislation to help lower prescription drug costs, expand skills training opportunities to fill good-paying jobs, secure relief during the coronavirus pandemic, and to protect our Great Lakes. I'm working to rebuild our economy by pushing to expand Made in America manufacturing and supporting our small businesses. And as a leader on national security and veterans' issues, my top priority is keeping Michigan safe. I've worked with both parties to pass into law legislation to strengthen our military, and take care of our veterans by expanding apprenticeship opportunities and ensure those who are struggling with PTSD have access to the care they deserve.What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?1) Ensuring Michigan Families Have Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care Coverage. I have worked to strengthen the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and lower prescription drug costs. I've also called for opening a special enrollment period to ensure Michiganders who've lost their jobs due to COVID-19 can more easily get access to health care. Now, as we continue to work through the pandemic we need to ensure programs like Medicare and Medicaid are adequately funded. \n",
      "2) Rebuilding Our Economy. I'm working to rebuild our economy, create good-paying jobs in Michigan and strengthen our middle class. I've also been working on boosting manufacturing, taking back our supply chain from China, and supporting small business and expanding skills training programs. Previously, I worked in business for over two decades, so I understand the unique challenges that small businesses face. \n",
      "3) Protecting the Great Lakes. I believe we need to invest in clean energy jobs and support measures to tackle the threat of climate change, which exacerbates current challenges in the Great Lakes like algal blooms and invasive species. I am committed to reducing carbon pollution, and building a clean energy economy that balances our economic needs and provides environmental justice. I'm proud to have helped pass legislation that provides funding to restore our Great Lakes, and passed my proposal to prevent and plan for a potentially catastrophic oil spill on the Great Lakes.What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?My father served in World War II and was a public school teacher here in Michigan for decades. My mom was a nurse's aide and union steward. They instilled in me the importance of service, determination, fairness and integrity. And those values are what I carry with me as I fight for Michiganders - to solve problems, work across the aisle and get things done. Those values are critical to  finding common sense, practical and bipartisan solutions to the challenges facing Michigan and our nation. As someone with a background in business, the military and local government, and as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I've always worked with people of varying backgrounds and know how important it is to put politics and partisanship aside to do what's right and deliver results.What was your very first job? How long did you have it?My first job was a newspaper route.What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?A critical challenge facing our country is rebuilding our economy and working to develop a comprehensive national strategic plan for American manufacturing to ensure Michiganders have good-paying jobs and addressing the glaring vulnerabilities in our medical supply chain. That's why I've put in the work of building relationships with my colleagues across the aisle to get the job done for Michigan, which is why I've been ranked as one of the most bipartisan and effective members of the Senate.Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?I'm proud to be ranked as one of the most bipartisan and effective members of the Senate. Those two things go hand in hand -  to get things done, you have to find common ground. And that requires building relationships with other Senators across the political spectrum.\n",

      "“Protecting Michigan Families from CoronavirusA MESSAGE FROM GARY:For so many people, this is an incredibly uncertain and difficult time. The challenges the Coronavirus pandemic has brought are unprecedented, and we will have to work especially hard in the weeks ahead to fight this virus and the health and economic concerns it brings.Michigan has been home to my family for five generations, and I’ve lived here my whole life. In difficult moments like this, I often think of how resilient the people of our state are — it’s just in our DNA. We’ve seen tough days before, and we will rise to meet this challenge and face it as we always have during times of turmoil: together.And here is my promise to you: I will always stand up for Michigan. My number one priority is to keep you and your family safe, and I will never waver in my commitment to fighting for financial aid for working families, equipment to protect our doctors and nurses on the front lines and, now more than ever, working to expand access to affordable health care.Stay safe. Stay strong. We will get through this together.What Gary’s doing:Supporting Essential Workers: Gary is working to pass his proposal for a Heroes Fund to increase pay for essential workers on the frontlines of the pandemic.Providing Historic Unemployment Aid: Gary wrote, introduced and helped pass the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Act to expand unemployment benefits and get more aid for more workers over a longer period of time.Expanding Free Testing for Coronavirus: Gary introduced and passed the Free COVID-19 Testing Act to make sure all Americans have adequate testing capabilities.Protecting Small Businesses: Gary fought to secure additional relief for small businesses, including $60 billion for minority-owned businesses and community lenders while working to expand the funding available for small business loans and grants in the CARES Act.Getting Funding for Hospitals, Health Care Workers and Our Health Care System: Gary worked tirelessly to provide more critical funding for already overstretched hospitals and is continuing to fight to get health care workers the supplies they need to stay safe on the front lines of the pandemic.Bringing Manufacturing Back to Michigan: One of Gary’s top priorities is to bring back American manufacturing of PPE, critical drugs and medical supplies — that’s why he’s fighting to pass his legislation to strengthen and boost Michigan manufacturing.Holding Government Accountable: Gary is investigating the federal government’s response to the pandemic and fighting for *Michigan to get its fair share of relief, including demanding answers on how small business loans were misallocated to large corporations and ensuring hospitals and health care workers get critical funding.Strengthening Michigan’s EconomyGary knows that our economy is powered by middle-class families like the one he grew up in, and he knows to keep our state strong, we have to stand up for small businesses. Small businesses create two out of every three jobs, and Gary believes that protecting them means strengthening the backbone of our state.After working for over 20 years in business, Gary understands the unique challenges that small businesses face. During his time in the Senate, he has cut red tape and fought to ensure small businesses have the resources to thrive. Additionally, he helped secure a bipartisan law that helps entrepreneurs understand patent laws to protect their intellectual property.Gary knows that Michigan has the greatest workforce in the world, and we have to expand their opportunities for our state to thrive. That’s why he’s working to create jobs by fighting to ensure Michigan is a manufacturing hub, and is expanding access to workforce training and skilled trades programs that have literally built our state’s economy. Gary knows that for many families, a certificate that leads to a good job can mean just as much as any four-year degree and has passed bipartisan legislation to expand career and technical education, apprenticeship programs and trade school opportunities for high school students and veterans.Expanding Access to Affordable Health CareGary knows that no one should have to make the impossible decision between paying their medical bills and putting food on the table. That’s why he was proud to vote for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and has opposed attempts to repeal it to protect the 1.7 million Michiganders with pre-existing conditions who depend on the ACA for protections.Though Gary is proud to support the ACA, he’s also working for common sense fixes to make it work better for Michigan. That’s why he supported repealing the Cadillac Tax on high-cost employer plans to ease the burden on small business owners. He’s also working to expand coverage for middle-class families with solutions like a Medicare public option.Gary knows that far too many seniors and others who rely on prescription medications are struggling to keep up with their skyrocketing costs. That’s why he helped lead and pass bills to get generic versions of insulin into the market more quickly, expand access to more affordable generic drugs and prevent big pharmaceutical companies from monopolizing the generic drug market. In addition, Gary helped introduce legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices to keep costs low and make sure more Michiganders can afford their life-saving medications.Protecting Public Schools and EducationGary and his family are proud products of Michigan’s public schools. Through his father, a public school English teacher, Gary saw firsthand the importance of having access to quality education. That’s why he’s advocated for better education opportunities for all Michiganders, from pushing to make higher education more affordable to expanding access to technical, vocational and apprenticeship programs. Gary has prioritized fighting so everyone — no matter where they live — can have access to affordable education.In addition, Gary has stood up to special interests that have tried to gut funding for public education. From the beginning, he opposed the nomination and confirmation of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and has fought against her attempts to cut funding for Michigan’s public schools, including critical after school programs.Gary is pushing to expand funding opportunities for technical and vocational education programs for Michigan high school students to help them realize their full potential and have the skills they need on the job. He’s passed legislation to lessen the burden of student loans and promote diversity in STEM fields, and he’s helped to secure a record amount of funding for Pell Grants to make higher education more affordable for all students, regardless of zip code.Defending the Great Lakes and EnvironmentIn Michigan, the Great Lakes are central to our culture, economy and way of life. Gary grew up spending his summers on the Great Lakes and knows that we need to protect them for future generations.Years before it was mainstream, Gary was working to combat climate change and defend our lakes by advocating for a Great Lakes drilling ban. While in the Senate, Gary authored and passed into law bipartisan measures to protect our lakes from catastrophic oil spills, and he successfully fought against budget cuts that would have eliminated Great Lakes funding, even helping secure historic Great Lakes funding to clean up contaminated lakes, beaches and waterways and prevent the spread of invasive species.While areas like Flint and Detroit continue to struggle for clean and accessible water, Gary has taken action to uplift and support these communities by leading the fight to successfully pass emergency aid for Flint after the lead water crisis. He’s also helping to secure funding to expand Head Start for communities affected by lead water pollution and is a leader on cleaning up toxic PFAS chemicals, which have contaminated drinking water across the state. Gary helped convene the Senate’s first-ever hearing on PFAS, passed into law a ban on the use of PFAS firefighting foams on military bases, which has been a key source of PFAS contaminated water in our state, and he’s led efforts to establish clear standards on cleaning up and limiting exposure to these toxic chemicals.Keeping Michigan SafeAs the Ranking Member on the Homeland Security Committee and a member of the Armed Services Committee, Gary’s top priority is keeping Michigan — and the people who defend us — safe. He has worked to ensure our troops serving overseas are cared for, including fighting to get them a pay raise and working to ensure our men and women in uniform have the best equipment to protect them.He also knows that we have to take care of our servicemembers once they come home. That’s why he wrote and passed into law a bill to help ensure those who are struggling with PTSD have access to the care they deserve. Further, Gary wrote a bipartisan law to help expand apprenticeship opportunities for veterans using their GI bill benefits to ensure they have the skills needed for a good-paying job.Gary is working with members of both parties to strengthen our military, keep America safe and secure our borders. He wrote and passed key security measures, led the passage of critical anti-terrorism legislation and voted for over $1 billion in enhanced border security. He passed into law his bipartisan bill to better secure our border against illegal crossings and illicit drug trafficking, and he coauthored a bipartisan bill to hire 4,000 more border security officers to fix a critical shortage in staffing. He also wrote and passed bipartisan legislation to hire hundreds of inspectors at our borders to stop contaminated products from entering and protect Michigan’s marketplaces and our nation’s food supply.Gary is proud to be an independent voice for Michigan in the Senate, which means ensuring our laws are enforced and keeping our northern and southern borders strong and secure. He supports a comprehensive approach to immigration reform and common sense laws to strengthen border security.Fighting For WomenEmpowering and supporting women is personal to Gary — he’s a father to two daughters, a husband and a brother of two sisters. He’s fought for women throughout his career.One of the first bills he cosponsored in Congress was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to ensure that women get equal pay for equal work, and he continues to champion efforts to combat pay discrimination. To build more opportunities for women in the workforce, Gary passed bipartisan legislation to help increase the number of women working in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields.Gary understands the unique challenges women face in dealing with domestic abuse and violence. That’s why he supported the landmark Violence Against Women Act to reduce intimate partner violence and provide resources to ensure that more women can be safe and healthy. He also led passage of the PAWS Act to support domestic violence shelters in providing pet-friendly housing so the facilities can provide support for both survivors and their pets.Gary has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood, NARAL and the National Organization for Women (NOW) as an advocate for reproductive freedom and the ability for everyone to make personal choices about their own bodies.Standing Up For Agriculture and Rural CommunitiesGary is a tireless advocate for Michigan’s farming and rural communities. He led the way to help protect our farmers from unfair foreign trade practices. In the Senate, he introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure our laws are enforced and that Michigan farmers — especially our cherry growers — are not disadvantaged by unfair trade practices.He has also supported renegotiating unfair trade deals like NAFTA, and he fought to improve and voted for the bipartisan USMCA to help level the playing field for our farmers, workers and businesses. As the leading Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, Gary fought hard to pass bipartisan legislation into law to hire hundreds of agricultural inspectors at our borders to stop contaminated products from entering and protect Michigan’s marketplace and our nation’s food supply.When it comes to supporting those who live in our rural communities, Gary knows you can’t leave anyone behind. That’s why he’s working to expand broadband internet access to support telehealth, remote learning and precision agriculture. Given that so many rural Michiganders rely on the vital services the US Postal Service provides, Gary has led the fight to maintain the service’s funding, especially during the COVID-19 crisis.Equity and JusticeGary understands that African American and other underserved communities in Michigan are facing unique challenges. That’s why he’s focused on passing policies to empower these communities and uplift the work of local leaders and organizations. Whether working for immediate action to reform our broken criminal justice system, fighting to protect voting rights and expanding vocational training opportunities or working to address disparities in housing, health care and economic prosperity, Gary’s focused on building opportunities for everyone.Gary is working with local community stakeholders including faith leaders, civil rights organizations and law enforcement groups to pass critical reforms to ensure greater oversight over law enforcement and to address racial disparities in policing. With the support of the NAACP, he introduced the bipartisan National Criminal Justice Commission Act to establish the first top-to-bottom review of our justice system in over 50 years and help set the agenda on critical reforms for our criminal justice system. He has also cosponsored national reforms like an outright ban on the use of chokeholds, accountability in the event of the use of deadly force by law enforcement and the requirement for fair and impartial independent investigations. Moreover, he supports measures to require federal law enforcement to clearly identify themselves and promotes the use of evidence-based practices to inform crime reduction programs.Gary also knows that racial inequities in health care must be combatted by making care more affordable and accessible. In his work to expand access to affordable health care, Gary is a strong advocate of the Affordable Care Act and has passed legislation to help get lower-cost generic insulin and other generic medications to the market. Further, he cosponsored and passed the Maternal Health Accountability Act to create a grant program to help states track and reduce maternal deaths, which disproportionately impact Black women.The need for clean water impacts every corner of the state, and Gary has championed policies to improve infrastructure so communities across our state have access to clean drinking water. To provide aid to Flint during the water crisis, Gary fought tirelessly for emergency assistance. He secured $100 million in emergency infrastructure for the city in addition to authoring legislation to require the government to investigate efforts to mitigate lead contamination.Gary knows that uplifting Michigan’s urban areas and city centers has to be a priority. In Flint, he helped bring in $30 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Grant to replace the Atherton East public housing complex, plus nearly half a million dollars for Flint Community Schools to hire staff and improve the learning environment for students affected by leaded water. In Detroit, Gary supported the purchase of 59 new city transit buses and funding to revitalize Belle Isle. Gary has also secured funding for resources to keep communities and places of worship safe.Gary is an advocate for the Minority Business Development Agency, and helped pass the Small Business Jobs Act to boost small businesses in and around Detroit through tax credits and access to low-interest loans. He has fought for and secured additional relief for minority-owned businesses and community lenders impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gary is also an original cosponsor of the For the People Act, which would expand voting rights and reduce the influence of big money in politics.Getting Results for MichiganGary has never been afraid to cross the aisle to get results and make government work for Michigan. That’s why nonpartisan groups like the Center for Effective Lawmaking, the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy have ranked him as one of the most effective and bipartisan members of the Senate. He has been ranked the fourth most effective Democrat in the Senate and the 12th most bipartisan Senator overall, in addition to receiving the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Jefferson-Hamilton Award for Bipartisanship.Throughout his time in the Senate, Gary has been a leader on bipartisan legislation to change the way we treat veterans with mental health issues, streamline government to save taxpayers millions of dollars and help ensure Michiganders have the skills they need to find good-paying jobs.Last year, he championed the Great Lakes by securing historic funding for restoration projects and developing strategies to prevent and respond to catastrophic oil spills. He also wrote and passed a bill to expand apprenticeship opportunities for our veterans, ensuring those who serve our nation have prospects for good jobs when they come home to Michigan.As a leader on the Homeland Security Committee, Gary passed into law his bill to hire hundreds of agricultural inspectors at our borders to stop contaminated products from entering the country. Further, he worked across the aisle to provide additional resources to religious institutions and houses of worship to increase security from domestic terrorist attacks.And when it comes to making government work, for Gary, it’s personal. Growing up, he was raised to believe you don’t spend money you don’t have, and those are the values he brings with him to work every day. He’s run his office so frugally that he’s returned over $2 million in taxpayer dollars to the U.S. Treasury and passed legislation to cut red tape and streamline the government to save taxpayers’ millions.Gary is constantly working to keep Washington transparent and responsible. Under his oversight, Gary has helped pass legislation to eliminate millions in wasteful government spending and has led investigations to hold government agencies accountable for improper spending.[89]”—Gary Peters’ campaign website (2020)[90]\n",

      "“Jobs & Economy:We make things in Michigan, and Gary is proud of that tradition. Whether it’s investing in Michigan Main Street businesses, strengthening our automotive industry, expanding agricultural innovation, or promoting entrepreneurial talents, Gary will continue to lead the fight for Michigan’s economic future and a strong middle class in the U.S. Senate.Health Care:Medicare has helped make health care affordable for thousands of Michigan seniors, and Gary is committed to ensuring it can be relied upon for generations to come. He has consistently opposed the Republican Ryan Budget Plan to privatize Medicare and end the guaranteed benefit for our seniors, and will continue to fight against any efforts to cut such a vital program.America needs more than just a sick-care system. We need to move towards a results-driven, sustainable, health care system that puts the well-being of our families first. Gary will work in the U.S. Senate to make sure health care reform continues to move forward in a practical, common-sense way.Military & Veterans:The son of a World War II veteran, Gary was instilled the importance and value of service. When he was 34 years old, Gary felt compelled to serve his country and joined the U.S. Navy Reserve. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Gary volunteered and served again. Trained as a sharpshooter in pistol and rifle and as a Seabee Combat Specialist, Gary eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander.When our veterans file claims with the VA, they shouldn’t be subjected to staggering backlogs. Gary is working with his colleagues to reduce the backlog at the VA and get our veterans and their families the benefits they’ve earned.All of us are indebted to the men and women that serve our nation. And Gary will continue to fight for Michigan’s service men and women, veterans, and their families.[89]”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Good Jobs and a Strong EconomyTim grew up in a middle class family, working in his dad’s ironworking shop in Kansas City. He knows that our economy is strong when workers and families have access to good paying jobs, higher wages, and the skills to succeed and get ahead.When Tim was Governor, Virginia was ranked the best state for business — and it’s because we invest in our people, value our diversity, and grow the talented and educated workforce that makes our economy thrive. Tim understands that, to bring more jobs to Virginia, we must have a skilled workforce. He cosponsored the Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act to give businesses incentives to hire individuals in apprenticeship programs in high-demand fields such as health care, technology or manufacturing. He also introduced the bipartisan JOBS Act to help expand employment in high-demand fields by allowing individuals to use Pell Grants for job training programs.Tim also wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and he sponsored the Raise the Wage Act to do just that. He will keep fighting to ensure that 41 million workers, including nearly 786,000 Virginians, can see higher pay by raising the minimum wage.Health Care for AllTim is fighting to expand health care for all Virginians.When President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Tim fought back — standing up for the tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Virginians who would have had their health care taken away. Since the ACA was signed into law, more than 400,000 Virginians have gained access to health insurance, and Tim will continue to oppose efforts to roll it back. He will never support eliminating protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and he will continue to ensure that plans provide “essential health benefits,” such as coverage for pregnancy, maternity, newborn care, mental health, and substance use disorders.Tim also has a plan called Medicare X, which would give all Virginians access to a plan similar to Medicare. This public option would give more Virginians a real choice when it comes to health insurance, at a lower cost. He opposes cuts to Medicare and believes Virginia should expand Medicaid so hundreds of thousands more Virginians can get access to care. Refusing to expand Medicaid would cost Virginia tens of thousands of jobs and tens of millions of dollars. It’s a no-brainer, yet the leading Republican candidates for Senate vocally oppose it.Tim will also continue to defend the Children’s Health Insurance Program. As Governor, Tim increased the number of children enrolled in CHIP, and more than 68,000 Virginia kids rely on this program for their health care. Earlier this year, after Republicans let CHIP funding lapse, Tim worked hard to help secure a six-year extension of the program.Tim has also led efforts in the Senate to combat drug addiction, including the opioid and heroin epidemic that threatens Virginia and the rest of the country. He believes new treatments, including medical marijuana, can help address this crisis, and he has fought to expand federal funding for states, like Virginia, to dedicate new resources for drug treatment and prevention.Civil Rights and Equal JusticeEquality is one of the foundational principles of America — that “all men are created equal” — and Tim has spent his life trying to even the playing field for all people. Tim began his career as a civil rights lawyer, defending people who’d faced racial discrimination from banks, landlords, real estate firms, and local governments. During his time as Governor, he promoted equal protection by banning discrimination against state employees on the basis of race, sex, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, age, political affiliation, veteran status or disability.Tim knows that diversity and inclusion strengthen our communities. That’s why he has been outspoken in opposing President Trump’s agenda to ban Muslims from entering America, deport millions of people who only know America as home, and empower white nationalists who would take Virginia and America backwards. He knows that even though marriage equality is the law of the land, LGBTQ Americans still face many battles in the fight for equality: that’s why he’s fighting to pass workplace protections for LGBTQ citizens, so that no Virginian ever loses their job again because of their sexuality or sexual orientation. He’s been a proud champion of voting rights, sponsoring legislation to restore key provisions of the Voting Rights Act and working to expand early voting and access to the ballot box for all Virginians.Tackling Gun ViolenceToo many of our communities are plagued by gun violence. Tim believes weapons of war have no place on our streets or in our schools, and he proudly boasts an F-rating from the NRA.Tim is a gun owner and supports the Second Amendment, but he also believes we must take concrete steps to reduce gun violence. He supports universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and improving our mental health system. This is personal for Tim, too. He was governor when the shooting at Virginia Tech took place — and after the shooting, Tim brought Democrats and Republicans together to strengthen the background check system and improve mental health.Tim authored the Responsible Transfer of Firearms Act, which would hold people responsible for selling or transferring a firearm to someone who is barred by federal law from possessing firearms, and he co-sponsored legislation that would close a loophole which currently allows gun sales to proceed if a background check is not completed after 72 hours.Supporting Veterans and Our MilitaryVirginia is home to every branch of the military and the largest naval station in the world. As the father of a Marine, Tim understands that military families, veterans, and service members in Virginia and across the globe face unique challenges. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Tim will continue fighting to ensure that we are maintaining our promise to them, that our military has the support and investments it needs to meet its mission, and that we are doing all we can to help veterans transition into civilian life.The first bill Tim introduced in the Senate was the Troop Talent Act, which eases the transition of service members into the civilian workforce by helping them use the skills they developed in the military to obtain a workforce credential in order get a good job. There are more than 100,000 active duty and reserve members of the military in Virginia, and as co-chair of the Senate Military Family Caucus, Tim has authored bipartisan legislation to tackle military spouse unemployment and access to affordable child care for military families.Tim believes our country must fulfill its sacred promise to care for those who have served in uniform. That’s why he introduced legislation to improve veterans’ access to quality health care in a timely manner and opposes measures to privatize the VA.Women’s EqualityFor too long, we have undervalued and marginalized women in our society. Tim understands that women in America face a complex set of barriers to achieving true equality and has been a lifelong fighter for advancing women’s equality. As Lieutenant Governor and Governor, Tim made it a priority to update Virginia’s laws on sexual violence and improve the treatment of survivors, and he’s continued to actively support these measures in the Senate.Tim supports women’s constitutional rights to make their own health care decisions. He opposes efforts to restrict access to contraceptives and defund Planned Parenthood. He was an original co-sponsor of the Protecting Women’s Health from Corporate Interference Act, which would restore the contraceptive coverage requirement guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act.He supports equal pay for equal work and co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure men and women are paid equally for the same work. Tim has also passed legislation to help prevent sexual assault and harassment in our schools, colleges, and the military, and he co-sponsored the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.Strengthening Public Schools and EducationA good education is the foundation for a successful future, which is why Tim is a champion for our public schools. Tim and his wife Anne sent their three kids to Richmond public schools, so they know firsthand the concerns parents have about their children’s education and the power that good teachers have to change kids’ lives. Tim will fight efforts to divert public school funding to private schools, and he supports raising teacher pay and providing teachers with the tools and resources they need in the classroom.As Mayor, Tim built four new schools in Richmond, the city’s first new schools in a generation, and increased education spending by 30 percent. As Governor, he worked with the legislature to expand the number of children enrolled in Pre-K by nearly 40 percent, a commitment to expanding and improving education that helped lead to Education Week naming Virginia the state where a child was most likely to have a successful life.In the Senate, Tim is on the key committee dealing with education issues — the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — where he has worked to ensure that students have the skills to be successful after high school. Tim believes in the power of career and technical education (CTE) to strengthen links between the classroom and the workplace and to help students gain the skills that will lead to productive, successful lives after graduation, which is why he introduced legislation to help schools recruit and train high-quality CTE teachers. Tim also introduced the PRE-K Act to help more states expand early childhood education, and he supports legislation to help students earn college credits in high school in order to cut the cost of earning a college degree.Higher Education and Job TrainingTim is fighting to ease the crushing burden of student debt and make higher education and job training available to all Virginians. Tim believes that, if we can pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut for those at the very top, we can find a way to make college debt-free for students who need it — and he recently worked to pass his legislation to help forgive student loans for public service workers, such as teachers, soldiers, and social workers. He also co-sponsored the Fairness for Struggling Students Act, which would make it easier for students to get relief from their private loan debt through bankruptcy.Ensuring that we have a skilled workforce will not only benefit students but drive new businesses and employers to Virginia. A longtime leader in promoting career and technical education, he is fighting for parity in how we view workforce programs and traditional four-year college, including by expanding Pell Grants to cover short-term job training programs. Tim also created the bipartisan Senate Career and Technical Education Caucus to help more Americans acquire the education and skills to help them find employment and enjoy successful careers, and he supports legislation to foster partnerships between community college and businesses to place more students in good jobs.Keeping America Safe and Strengthening DiplomacyOur country is safer when we are strong on the world stage, which is why Tim has consistently spoken out against the Trump administration’s reckless foreign policy and the dangerous actions he’s taken to erode U.S. leadership around the world. He is a leading voice in demanding that presidents — no matter their party — cannot unilaterally wage war without congressional approval.As a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees — and the father of a Marine — Tim knows how important it is to minimize the risk of unnecessary war and maximize the chance that our nation will decisively win any war we must fight. That’s why he’s been an outspoken critic of President Trump’s efforts to undercut diplomacy around the world, and advocated for the U.S. to stand by our diplomatic deals and honor our commitments to the global community.Fighting for Immigrant CommunitiesTim believes that America is made stronger by its diversity, and that the promise of the American Dream is threatened by an anti-immigrant agenda led by the Trump administration. Tim believes we need comprehensive immigration reform and strongly supported legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 to create a path to citizenship and fund border security. During that debate, Tim proudly delivered the first-ever Senate floor speech in Spanish.Tim has been an outspoken opponent of President Trump’s attempts to ban immigration from Muslim countries, harshly restrict legal immigration, and threaten TPS recipients and Dreamers with deportation. Tim firmly believes immigrants enrich our society and bring skills and talents that help ensure we remain competitive in a global economy. That’s why he is a strong supporter of the Dream Act and has been working with his colleagues to find a solution to protect Dreamers and TPS recipients from deportation.Standing With Our SeniorsSeniors should not spend their later years worrying about their economic security or whether they will have access to good health care. Tim has consistently opposed measures to gut Social Security and remove Medicare funding.On Medicare’s 49th anniversary, Tim spoke on the Senate floor about the importance of the program, calling it “one of the best programs that this nation has ever embraced.” He is also a sponsor of legislation to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for seniors by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices.Tim supports increasing funding for Alzheimer’s research, introduced an Alzheimer’s caregivers bill, and opposes federal cuts to the Meals on Wheels program. He has also worked closely with Senator Mark Warner to provide funding for the building of additional senior facilities in Virginia.Protecting Our EnvironmentClimate change imperils our planet’s future and threatens our economy. Tim believes that protecting our natural resources and environment are critical for our long-term health, safety and prosperity. That’s why he is fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to gut federal environmental protections, including for clean air and water, and speaking out against President Trump’s decision to abandon U.S. leadership by withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.Tim opposes offshore drilling in Virginia. He is fighting the Trump administration’s attempt to ignore the voices of Virginians by rushing through the process to open the waters of our coastlines to drilling. Tim has also been critical of how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast Pipelines and has called for FERC to rehear arguments and conduct another vote on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.Tim will continue to fight the Trump administration’s decision to abandon the Clean Power Plan, a move that harms the transition toward clean and renewable energy. Virginia is uniquely threatened by sea level rise, which is why Tim has introduced legislation to make regions like Hampton Roads more resilient in the face of flooding and extreme weather events. He is also a longtime champion for restoring the Chesapeake Bay.[109]”—Tim Kaine’s campaign website (2018)[110]\n",

      "Superdelegates, in 2016, were automatic delegates to the Democratic National Convention, meaning that, unlike regular delegates, they were not elected to this position. Also unlike regular delegates, they were not required to pledge their support to any presidential candidate, and they were not bound by the results of their state's presidential primary election or caucus. In 2016, superdelegates included members of the Democratic National Committee, Democratic members of Congress, Democratic governors, and distinguished party leaders, including former presidents and vice presidents. All superdelegates were free to support any presidential candidate of their choosing at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[129]\n",

      "Virginia had 108 delegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Of this total, 95 werepledged delegates. National party rules stipulated how Democratic delegates in all states were allocated. Pledged delegates were allocated to a candidate in proportion to the votes he or she received in a state's primary or caucus. A candidate was eligible to receive a share of the state'spledged delegatesif he or she won at least 15 percent of the votes cast in the primary or caucus. There were three types of pledged Democratic delegates: congressional district delegates, at-large delegates, and party leaders and elected officials (PLEOs). Congressional district delegates were allocated proportionally based on the primary or caucus results in a given district. At-large and PLEO delegates were allocated proportionally based on statewide primary results.[132][133]\n",
